# Number-Guessing-Game
OVERVIEW
A node-based number guessing game based on what the user enters in CLAs.

MAIN FEATURES
Each stage of the game prompts the user.  The user can enter their name and receive a greeting.  When they enter a number it sets the max for the number guessing game.  Guesses are validated and users will receive warnings if their guess is not a number and a message if the guess is too high or low.  Once guessed, the user can choose to play again or not.  The game loop contains calls to each function and passes in the parameters needed for each.

TECHNOLOGIES
Uses readlineSync for CLAs and is run in node.
